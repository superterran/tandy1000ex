     Fastdv.com speeds up the head stepping on you floppy drive. The
speed byte is stored in byte $0A of the file. Usually DOS defaults
the stepping speed to $DF. This program speeds it up to $EF. This can
speed up head seeks, and sometimes allow noisy drives to run quietly.
If you get seek errors when accessing your floppy disk after running
this program, then you should not use this program. This program is
not a TSR.
