*              NFORMAT - THE SUPERIOR DISK FORMATTER                *
*********************************************************************

     NFORMAT is a disk formatter designed to dynamically format
floppy disks for MS/PC-DOS. The internal parameter editor or command
line options let you specify parameters that allow you to get up to
23% more data space from your floppy disks.


NFORMAT offers:

     * A self-contained, user-friendly menu

     * Mouse support!

     * Automatic setup for standard and maximum formats

     * An editor for the disk parameters

     * Superior media defect detection

     * Multiple verification techniques

     * Easy to use command line parameters

     * Support for older versions of DOS

Recommended for the simplest operation:

   + A standard 360k, 720k, 1.20m, or 1.44m drive

   + An AT class machine or better

   + MS/PC-DOS version 3.2 or higher

   + A mouse!


How to use NFORMAT:

     Simply run the program NFORMAT. If you are using an AT class
machine with DOS 3.2 or higher, NFORMAT will automatically retrieve
the parameters for your drives. The parameters are then saved to disk
in the file NFORMAT.CFG.
     The menu will list the drive letters followed by the data size
of the disk format. To select the format you desire, highlight the
format using the arrow keys and press ENTER. If you are using a
mouse, you can select by using the mouse cursor. Move the cursor to
the menu item and press the first mouse button.


     NOTE: Throughout NFORMAT, the first mouse button has the same
           function as the ENTER key. Also, the second mouse button
           has the same function as the ESCAPE key.


     The formatting screen will display all available information
about the format you requested. NFORMAT will prompt you to insert the
disk you wish to format. At this point, you may press ESCAPE to exit
back to the menu, or press any other key to begin formatting.


     WARNING!: Formatting the disk permanently erases any
               data on that disk!


     While formatting, any bad sector information will appear in the
BAD SECTORS window in the upper right of the screen.  The current
process will appear in the box in the center of the screen.  Any
system errors will appear in the upper left of the screen, and prompt
for user action.

     When NFORMAT finishes formatting the disk, NFORMAT will prompt
you to enter a volume label. Since the label is written directly to
the disk you may enter both upper and lower case characters.

     If you should need to exit NFORMAT before formatting is
complete, you may press escape. The error box will prompt you to
confirm that you wish to exit.  Once formatting is complete, NFORMAT
will return you to the main menu. From the main menu you may, if you
wish, format another disk.



     WARNING: Exiting the formatter before formatting is complete
              will cause the disk to be unusable to DOS. To make the
              disk useable it will need to be reformatted.


*********************************************************************

About the Menu:

     When you are in the SELECT FORMAT menu, the entry that you wish
to use is highlighted. The highlight bar moves by using the up
arrow key and the down arrow key. Selecting a format may also be done
using the mouse.

Once you have highlighted the entry, you may press:

 ESCAPE- Immediately leaves NFORMAT.

 ENTER - This accepts the format and enters the formatter.

 L     - Reloads the disk parameter configuration file (NFORMAT.CFG)
         from disk.

 V     - Turns disk verification on or off. Verification should
         always be ON.

 E     - Allows you to edit the parameters for your drive.

 I     - Inserts a new record for the parameter table. This record is
         temporarily filled by a copy of the format above or below it.

 D     - Deletes an unwanted entry in the menu.

 M     - Allows you to move an entry around in the menu.

 S     - Saves the menu database with any changes to NFORMAT.CFG.
         NFORMAT.CFG will be in the same path/directory as the copy
         of NFORMAT.EXE.

 R     - Reconfigures the menu so it will display the current
         standard drive parameters.  This is easier than manually
         erasing the NFORMAT.CFG file and then running NFORMAT again.

     When you first run NFORMAT (with no parameters), the menu
program will automatically configure for your disk system. The
configuration routine scans for information about drives 0-3. It will
place the normal format for the drive followed by the maximum format
for that disk type. If the drive is high density, NFORMAT will add
the low density format and the maximum low density format for that
drive.


*******************************************************************

The parameter editor:

     The parameter editor box appears to the right of the menu when
you select the edit function.  You may highlight the parameter you
wish to edit and then press return, or select with the mouse.  Some of
the values are in hexidecimal, and others in normal decimal. You may
enter values in normal decimal as well as hexidecimal. All hexidecimal
numbers must be preceded by a "$". Once you finish entering the new
value, NFORMAT will re-calculate the other parameters. You may notice
some of the other numbers changing.  The editor places a "*" by your
new value to show that it is protected. Being protected means that
NFORMAT can not recalculate or change your new parameter. If you need
to remove this protection, select the item you wish to unprotect.
Type a single space followed by ENTER, and the protection for that
item will disappear.

 The parameters are as follows:

  TRACKS ON DISK:   This number represents the number of positions
                    that the drive head may take. This number is
                    normally 40 or 80

  SECTORS ON TRACK: This defines the number of separate data areas
                    that pass under the head each disk rotation.

  NUMBER OF HEADS:  There are always at least 2 heads on a disk
                    drive. There is no need to change this value
                    unless the disk bios returns an incorrect value.

  PHYSICAL DRIVE #: Normally, the physical drive values for A: is
                    zero and for B: is one. Some machines may have
                    drives as physical 2 and 3 (usually D: or E: ).
                    NFORMAT will always report physical $02 and $03
                    as X: and Y: and never in any way refer to normal
                    hard disks.

  ROOT DIR ENTRIES: Allows you to select the maximum number of files
                    that may be in the root directory.  This can free
                    space, and is useful if you have a few large
                    files that you want to put on a disk. (The
                    maximum value is 244 files)

SECTORS PER CLUSTER:This lets you select 1 or 2 sectors per DOS
                    cluster.  Normally 360k and 720k use 2 sectors
                    per cluster, and 1.20m and 1.44m use 1 sector per
                    cluster. A FAT using 2 sectors per cluster is
                    half the size of a FAT using 1 sector per
                    cluster.

  DISK FORMAT ID:   This byte, placed on the boot sector of the disk,
                    allows programs to quickly identify the disk
                    type.  Some versions of DOS use this as an
                    absolute ID. Normally, 1.44m is $F0, 1.20m and
                    720k are $F9 and 360k are $FD.

  FORMAT FILL BYTE: This value affects the error detection ability.
                    The standard value is $F6. This is a trivial
                    item, and there is usually no need change it.

  GAP LENGTH:       This defines the space between sectors. The less
                    space between sectors, the more sectors per
                    track. There always needs to be SOME gap.

  INTERLEAVE:       This option allows you change the order of the
                    sectors on the disk. Normally the value is 1,
                    which means that the sectors are in the order of
                    1, 2, 3, 4, 5.... with one right after another. A
                    value of 2 will skip a sector: 1, 10, 2, 11, 3,
                    12 etc. The maximum value is one less than the
                    number of sectors per track.

  MEDIA DISCRIPTOR: This is the most important of the parameters.
                    Usually, XT machines do not use this, but ATs
                    almost always do. This byte, sent to the BIOS
                    defines the density and some other items.
                    NFORMAT automatically calculates this byte to
                    work with the other parameters, so there is no
                    need to change this byte. Should there be a need
                    though, the byte is calculated as follows:

                 REFERENCE HEX|BINARY   FOR

                    take one value from each section and add them all
                    together to get the media byte you desire.

  X SHIFT:          Normally, fast machines have a high step rate and
                    long gap length. After the last sector on a track
                    is read, the drive can switch or move the heads
                    and immediately find the first sector of the next
                    track. This means that the X value usually should
                    be 0.  If your system is slower, the head may
                    miss the first sector. Shifting lets slower
                    systems immediately find the first sector. A
                    shift value of 1 through 3 may speed up your disk
                    access.

  Y SHIFT:          Similar to the X shift. If you are formatting a
                    disk using 20 sectors per track, set the X and Y
                    shift to 1. The result will be a very fast disk.
                    21 sectors uses an interleave of 2, so the
                    interleaved sector acts as extra gap and no extra
                    shifting us usually needed.

  IMMEDIATE VERIFY: If set to yes, NFORMAT will format a track, and
                    then verify it. If set to no, NFORMAT will format
                    the entire disk, and then verify the entire disk.
                    Setting this option to "NO" is useful in
                    determining the maximum number of tracks on your
                    drive.

  LABEL DISK:       When set to yes, NFORMAT will prompt for a volume
                    label after formatting the disk. When set to no,
                    NFORMAT will not ask for a volume label.

********************************************************************

Command line parameters:

 Most of the parameters correspond with the definitions above. To get
 a list of all command line parameters use the parameter /?

The normal syntax for NFORMAT command line parameters is:

 NFORMAT <DRIVE:> <SWITCHES>

The first parameter is always the drive letter.

 P: Specifies the physical drive unit (0 - 3)
 T: Tracks on disk
 H: Number of heads
 S: Sectors per track
 C: Sectors per DOS cluster (1 or 2)
 R: Root directory entries
 I: Interleave
 F: Format ID for disk
 G: Gap of bytes between sectors
 B: Media discriptor
 X: X sector shift
 Y: Y sector shift
 Q: Quick format, no verify (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
 M: Use standard maximal density for disk
 L: Format a low density disk in a high density drive
 N: Do not ask for a volume label
 K: Batch mode, skip "insert disk"
 V: Non immediate verify

 hexidecimal numbers must start with a "$"

 Using command line parameters bypasses the menu.

**********************************************************************

The enhanced BOOT SECTOR:

     You will no longer have to put up with the old DOS "Non DOS disk
or disk error" message if you have a hard disk drive. You will no
longer have to remove the disk from your drive and press a key.  The
NFORMAT boot sector checks for the presence of a hard disk drive.  If
one is present, it will boot the hard disk. It will seem as if no
disk was in the drive. If you do not have a hard drive you will get
an "insert system disk" message.


**********************************************************************

Placing PC/MS-DOS system files:

     NFORMAT does not put system files on a floppy disk. This is
because different versions of DOS have their own way of placing
system files.  Your DOS should have a program called SYS.EXE or
SYS.COM. This program puts a DOS boot sector on the disk, transfers
the system file(s), and some versions transfer the COMMAND.COM
program.

     A few computers may, because of BIOS or DOS, be capable of
booting from a dynamically formatted system disk. These computers
usually will not require the BIOSPTCH program. If you can boot
dynamic system disks then that is fine, but ALWAYS keep a standard
(360k, 720k, 1.20m, 1.44m) system disk. If you change machines, you
probably will not be able to boot you dynamic system disks on the new
machine.

**********************************************************************

Do you need the BIOSPTCH program?

     If you want to use dynamic disks (1,74m, 830k, 430k) then
probably yes.  SOME machines do not (usually XT high density cards
with their own BIOS ROM). If you do not know and want to find out,
then try formatting a dynamic disk. Then, before installing BIOSPTCH,
try copying a large file (at least 32k) on to the disk and back.  If
no errors occur, you are OK.  Do not use a disk tester, because they
may bypass the DOS read/write. Other disk testers may go crazy
because they believe that all disks must be standard 360k, 720k,
1.20m, or 1.44m.

      To install BIOSPTCH, copy it into your root directory and then
      add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

       DEVICE=BIOSPTCH.SYS
      or for DOS 5 use:
       DEVICEHIGH=BIOSPTCH.SYS

     If you wish to only use the standard disk formats (360k, 720k,
1.20m and 1.44m), you will not need BIOSPTCH.

**********************************************************************


What does NFORMAT do?

     NFORMAT removes the frustration caused by trying to get old DOS
formatters to format a simple floppy disk which is slightly
different. Most disk formatters only allow formatting of several
different standard formats. Some dynamic disk formatters create slow
disks using poor error detection. The MS-DOS 5 formatter program is
so paranoid that the /U, unconditional format, switch must be added
for the program to actually low-level format a formatted disk.

WHY USE DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION?

     Dynamic configuration allows you to determine the format placed
on the disk, so you may get the most usable space from your disk as
possible. This is rather technical, so feel free to skip to the next
section.

     So, the label on your disk says that it has a capacity of 2
megabytes. When you format your disk you only get 1.44 megabytes.
Where do they get this 2.00 megs?

     The result comes from:
      SIZE:=((BAUD/8)/(RPM/60))*TRACKS*HEADS

BAUD: is the number of bits per second that the drive controller
      reads/writes to the disk. This value is either 500k, 300k, or
      250k, with k meaning one thousand. Dividing by eight gets the
      number of bytes.

RPM:  The number of times per minute which your disk spins. The
      normal value is 300 RPMs, but 1.20m drives and 8 inch drives
      use 360 RPMs.

     A standard "1.44 megabyte" drive would be baud=500k, rpm=300,
     with 80 tracks and two heads.

      ((500000/8)/(300/60))*80*2
      (62500/5)*80*2               {62500 BytesPS,5 RPS}
      (12500)*80*2                 {12500 bytes per track}
      2,000,000 bytes.             {total}


     THE CATCH IS that floppy disks must store MORE than just your
data. Each track contains information about the track, and sectors in
the track. The track ends with a variable gap to compensate for
random speed fluctuations in the drive motor. Each sector contained
within the track has identification bytes, and includes a checksum.
The checksum ensures that the data in the sector is correct. Also,
between sectors there is a gap. This gap helps the hardware locate
the sector, and allows time to pass for the processing of the sector.

     There are two gaps, one is constant, while the other is
variable. All of the standard PC formats spend 26% of the two
megabytes on non-user data. This is an unacceptably large amount of
wasted space. The low-density disks have small variable gaps, but
high density disks have extremely large variable gaps. In fact, the
default variable gap for a 1.44m disk is 108 bytes for each sector!
Because of this, only 18 sectors will fit on the track. By reducing
the gap from 108 to 12 bytes, 21 sectors will fit on the track. This
reduces the non-user space to 14%, a much better figure.

*********************************************************************


Determining the maximal format for your disk system:

     Some disk drives are capable of accessing more disk space than
others. For example, most Toshiba 3.5" drives can access 84 tracks,
one more than the average. Most Teac drives only work with the normal
83 tracks. Here is a list of maximum tracks for a few drives:

        TYPE                  TRACKS
        ----------------------------
        IBM half height 360k      40
        Tandon full height 360k   42
        Copal half height 360k    42
        Teac 1.20m                85
        Kaypro 2000 3.5" 720k     80
        Teac 1.44m                83
        Toshiba 720k              84
        Toshiba 1.44m             84

     NOTE: Individual results may vary, despite the listed drive
           brands.

     If you have an unusual drive system, you may wish to experiment
with different configurations. NFORMAT should be able to handle up to
31 sectors per track, although most floppies do not have that many.

      WARNING: Damage may occur to some old floppy drives if the
               disk head attempts to go beyond the last track.
               NFORMAT can not be held responsible for any damage
               caused to your drive.

      The easiest way to determine the maximum number of tracks
requires an error free disk and setting the VERIFY IMMEDIATE option
to NO. Try formatting the disk with the NFORMAT default maximum disk
parameters. NFORMAT will format the disk and then verify it. If the
number of tracks specified was too many, the drive head will remain
over the last track while attempting to format another track. The
track information that was already under the head is written over.
This will show up during verification as a completely unreadable
track. When lost tracks occur, you must decrease the number of
tracks.

     Immediate verification can not be used for this process. The
immediate verify will format a track and verify it before moving the
head to the next track. When formatting too many tracks, immediate
verification can not detect if the track will be overwritten.

     When trying a new maximum format, you should always make sure
that the new format is completely readable by your disk drive and
disk operating system.

     Finally, keep in mind that your maximum formats may not be
readable by other machines. You should assume that your machine is
the only machine that can read your maximized disks. The main reason
for this is that maximized disks usually require a computer to have
BIOSPTCH.SYS. Also, many disk drives may not be able to access as
many extra tracks as your drive.

     If you want to use your maximized disks on other computers, make
sure the format is compatible with the other disk drive(s).  You must
also have a normal disk with BIOSPTCH.SYS on it to install.


**********************************************************************

Disks-In-Drives:

     Both the 1.20m and 1.44m high density drives offer support for
low density disks, but there are some compatibility problems.

  360k disks in 1.20m drives:

     Despite anything you may of heard, it is simply NOT possible to
format 360k disks in 1.20m drives. This is why NFORMAT does not
include the 360k format in its menu for the 1.20m drive. Any 360k
disk formatted in or written to a 1.20m drive can not reliably be
read by 360k drives. The reason for this is that 1.20m drives read
and write thinner tracks than 360k drives. If there is any data
between the tracks, a 360k drive will read and mix both the thin
track, and the edge of the data. The result will be an unreadable
track. Also, if a thick 360k track is written to by a 1.20m drive, the
thin track will be surrounded by the edges of the thick track. Again,
the 360k drive would read both signals resulting in an unreadable
track.

     Since the low density disks can not be formatted high density,
the low density disks can take advantage of the thin tracks by
single stepping and doubling the number of tracks on the disk. A 360k
disk can be formatted reliably to 720k by doubling the tracks.
NFORMAT can take this a step further. By using 10 sectors per track,
and getting a few more tracks NFORMAT can format the disk to 850k.

     NOTE: BIOSPTCH.SYS usually will need to be installed to read
           720k and 850k disks in a 1.20m drive.

  1.20m disks in 360k drives:

     High density disks can not be formatted low density. The
magnetic material is usually designed to only store high frequency
data.

  3.5" disks:

     The high density 3.5 inch disks have a density notch in them to
automatically let the drive know what type of disk it is. This means
that it is impossible to format a 1.44m disk to 720k, and it is
impossible to format a 720k disk to 1.44m. (unless YOU put a notch in
the 720k disk, but that trick does not always work.)

     NOTE: Some cheap 1.44m drives were, for some reason, not built
     with density detection. Hopefully NFORMATs use of the media
     discriptor byte will avoid any problems.


**********************************************************************

Unusual Environments:

     If you are running NFORMAT on an old PC or XT class machine,
NFORMAT may receive incorrect information about your disk system. For
example, if NFORMAT is incorrectly told that all drives A: through D:
are 1.20m drives, you will have to manually edit the configuration.
If you are formatting using command line parameters, you will have to
specify the appropriate information for your drive.

     If you have a high density disk system in an XT, the controller
card should have a BIOS ROM which may report the drive parameters to
NFORMAT like an AT would.

     NFORMAT reports physical floppy drives 0 through 3 as A:,B:,X:,
and Y:, although DOS may assign drive letters anyway it feels like.  
So, if you try to format drive C: or X:, NFORMAT will attempt to 
format physical drive number 2.  Your hard disk is physical drive 
number 128, therefore NFORMAT can not even get close to your hard 
disk.  Physical drives 2 and 3 are listed by NFORMAT as X and Y to 
prevent any confusion. The DOS drive letters may vary on different 
machine, so NFORMAT refers to the drives by generic names X and Y.

      Under versions of DOS previous to 3.2, the drive type reported
by DOS usually just returns a random number. If the machine you are
running is an AT, NFORMAT ignores whatever DOS says anyway, and gets
the info from the BIOS. HOWEVER, On a PC/XT machine, BIOS may not
report correct information.  If NFORMAT detects the bad parameters,
it will assume you have two 360k floppy drives, A: and B:. If they
are not 360k (perhaps 720k), you may edit the parameters.

      Unusual disk device driver programs may interfere with the
operation of the BIOSPTCH.SYS program. These drivers will not allow
DOS to read more than the usual number of sectors per track from a
disk. This will result in errors such as "SECTOR NOT FOUND" while
attempting access to a maximized disks. If you get such errors and
your BIOSPTCH.SYS program is installed correctly, then you may need
to check for unusual disk device drivers. You may find such drivers
with exotic XT class floppy controllers. Sometimes this may be caused
by a DRIVPARM= statement in your CONFIG.SYS under some versions of
DOS. If you find such a driver, try removing it (but ALWAYS keep an
operational backup). Removing the driver may cause other formatters
and disk diagnostics programs to think your drive is a 360k drive. If
you are completely unable to access the drive after removing the
driver, then you will have to put the driver back.


     If you get a NON-DOS DISK ERROR message while attempting to
access a maximized disk, chances are your DOS does not support
dynamic disk media. This error almost always occurs on versions of DOS
previous to 3.2 . If you are using an old version of DOS, then the
best solution is to upgrade. Some old versions of DOS have an
alterable disk-type look up table in the IO.SYS file.

     If you have a monochrome system and the text is hard to read or
you get a blank screen, make sure that your have your video mode set
to mode number 2 (BW80). NFORMAT will detect the video mode and
display color only when color is set.

     NFORMAT alters some of the drive parameters during operation. If
you exit normally, using the escape key, the parameters are reset to
what they were before program execution. If you use any other
method of exit, the drive may behave erratically and require that
your system be rebooted.

**********************************************************************

     NFORMAT has been tested on a standard AT and XT system under
the following versions of DOS:

        PC-DOS 2.10
        MS-DOS 2.11
        PC-DOS 3.10
        PC-DOS 3.30
        MS-DOS 3.30
        MS-DOS 4.00
        PC-DOS 5.00
        MS-DOS 5.00

     NFORMAT has also been tested under MS-WINDOWS 3.1 in 386
enhanced mode.


      NOTE: Dynamic disks and Mouse support only works with DOS
            version 3.2 and later.
